Łukasiewicz is a procedural, strongly and statically typed language, with
lexical scope and reserved words, where the operations are input in prefix
notation.

This compiler generates the syntax tree for given Łukasiewicz code. It
currently supports basic operations with integers, that optionally can be
saved in variables.
