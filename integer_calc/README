An integer calculator using infix notation. Features addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, exponentiation, and use of parenthesis and unary
minus. Compile it with

    make

and run the resulting binary:

    $ ./intcalc
    > 2^(2 * 5 - 5)
    = 32

You can also feed it input using here-documents or file redirection:
    
    $ ./intcalc <<< "563 + 34"
    = 597
    $ echo "35412 + 41563" > sum
    $ ./intcalc < sum
    = 76975

Every input must be terminated with a newline; hence, the last line of a file
which does not respect this limitation will fail with a syntax error.

All invalid tokens will be ignored, and if there is any remaining valid input,
it will be processed (except in the case of external input, where it will
fail -- not so gracefully).
