An integer calculator using infix notation. Features addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, exponentiation, and use of parenthesis and unary
minus. Compile it with

    make

and run the resulting binary:

    $ ./intcalc
    2^(2 * 5 - 5)
    = 32

You can also feed it input using here-documents or file redirection:
    
    $ ./intcalc <<< "563 + 34"
    = 597
    $ echo "35412 + 41563" > sum
    $ ./intcalc < sum
    = 76975
